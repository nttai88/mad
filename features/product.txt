Product Hook Tool has its origins in the challenges of securing hooks at the enclosure of an agricultural area. Hook Tool was from an idea sketched / simple modeled by Jakob Engebakken and developed in the form of technical drawing in cooperation with Pavels Innovation AS. Product Hook Tool was initially a product that was sold in its intended device. During the development opened up both the challenges and out of the new solutions.
