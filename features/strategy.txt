There is currently one Standpoint shop in Norway, it is in Trondheim (Mercur shopping center). The intention is to operate on the basis of Trondheim, central Norway is defined as the primary area when it comes to the establishment of new stores. The reason for this is that we want a strong central control / overview in an establishment / growth phase. There are plans for another 3 shops, these are located in Steinkjer (Zebra mall), this will open mid-May 2004. It signed a contract with the Amphitheatre chain on the opening of a Standpoint Shop at Moa outside Ã…lesund, this will open in September 2004. In addition, we want to open another store in Trondheim, the location here is not clear. Through our work with Amfi chain and Sector, we expect to have opened 2 more stores in 2004, locations here is not clear.
